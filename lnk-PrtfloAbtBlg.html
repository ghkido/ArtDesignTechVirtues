                    <h3>About</h3>
                    <p>As you may have assumed I regard myself as somewhat of an artistic person. I am equally 
                        fond of technology and design generally speaking. That is the madness to my method for 
                        I actually believe coding these pages myself is fascinating up until the point when the 
                        page starts to look like a truck drove over it and I’m in a state of confusion as to why 
                        it didn’t turn out the way I intended it to. More to come!</p>

                        subject, which I hope to have better formulated and elaborate on later as well
