                    <p>I created this art for use in my website for a subject I hope to elaborate 
                        on later. Art In Beauty, Beauty in Art I wish to research what makes art 
                        beautiful and what makes a beautiful things art. Follow along in this 
                        exploration and see what develops.</p>
                    <h3>The Message, The Skill:</h3>
                    <p>What is the message, what do we see in this thing we call art? What does the 
                        artist want to express, Feeling, Emotion, A Visual Sentence?</p>

                    <p>Design is everywhere, everything created by man is designed whether in his/her 
                        mind then applied or expressed in some preeminent form. What is the importance 
                        of good design, how are we as individuals or groups of society affected by good 
                        or not so good design?</p>

                    <h3>How Technology Helps The Craftsman:</h3>
                    <p>Are Craftsman Techies? How often do we miss seeing the artistic element in 
                        everyday trade or scientific development. Where does Technology and Science
